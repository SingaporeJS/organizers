# Handbook TL;DR

*TL;DR attend a few tl;dr meetups and use common sense; this is just a reference*

Organiser handbook for an enjoyable TL;DR-formatted event.

## Venue Selection
Announce the date, time, and location early to give attendees notice and prevent clashes with other events.

Announce as far in advance as possible. Several months preferably.

Schedule multiple repeated meetups in advance. Shows a trend for hosts and visitors to commit to.

### Venue should...
- Offer guest/public wifi
- Preferably provide food, though this is never a requirement it just happens

### Host should...
- Have a single point of contact for organisers prior to the event
- Have at least one member present throughout the entire event

## Communication
Try to get a rough number of signups across all channels (FB, Meetup, etc). For free events the turn-up rate is 50%. Expect lots of sign-ups on the last few days.
